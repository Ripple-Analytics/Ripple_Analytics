### Selected High-Magnitude Improvements

#### Tier 1: Compounding Value (Magnitude: 9.5/10)
**1. Expand Enhanced Models with Comprehensive Failure Modes**

**Target Models** (Munger's Core Models):
1. **Inversion** - "Invert, always invert"
2. **Incentives** - "Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome"
3. **Margin of Safety** - From Graham/Buffett
4. **Circle of Competence** - Know what you know
5. **Opportunity Cost** - Every choice has a cost

**Why These 5:**
- Most frequently cited by Munger

**Effort**: 4-5 hours
**Impact**: Transforms abstract concepts into actionable decision tools
**Magnitude**: 9.5/10

#### Tier 2: System Intelligence (Magnitude: 9/10)
**2. Build Automated Failure Mode Detection System**

**Components:**
- Pattern matching for common failure modes
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Behavioral signal aggregation
- Real-time alerting system
- Integration with existing analysis pipeline

**Why This Matters:**

**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Impact**: Multiplies value of enhanced models
**Magnitude**: 9/10

#### Tier 3: Knowledge Extraction (Magnitude: 8.5/10)
**3. Extract Munger Wisdom from User's Google Drive**

**Approach:**
- Search Google Drive for Munger-related content
- Extract principles, quotes, case studies
- Integrate into enhanced models
- Link to failure modes and safeguards

**Why This Matters:**
- Leverages user's existing knowledge base
- Ensures authenticity to Munger's teachings
- Personalizes system to user's context
- Follows knowledge integration principle

**Expected Output:**
- Munger wisdom database
- Integration with enhanced models
- Personalized insights

**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Grounds system in authentic wisdom
**Magnitude**: 8.5/10

### Recommended Iteration Plan

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Models (4-5 hours)
1. **Inversion Model Enhancement**
   - 5 failure modes with case studies
   - Focus on: not considering opposite, confirmation bias, etc.
   
2. **Incentives Model Enhancement**
   - 5 failure modes with case studies
   - Focus on: misaligned incentives, unintended consequences, etc.

3. **Margin of Safety Model Enhancement**
   - 5 failure modes with case studies
   - Focus on: overconfidence, underestimating risk, etc.

4. **Circle of Competence Model Enhancement**
   - 5 failure modes with case studies
   - Focus on: overestimating knowledge, domain confusion, etc.

5. **Opportunity Cost Model Enhancement**
   - 5 failure modes with case studies
   - Focus on: ignoring alternatives, sunk cost fallacy, etc.

#### Phase 2: Automated Detection (2-3 hours)
1. Design detection algorithm
2. Implement pattern matching
3. Add alerting system
4. Write tests
5. Integrate with analysis pipeline

#### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (1 hour)
1. Run full test suite
2. Update documentation
3. Create iteration report
4. Commit and push

### Success Metrics
- Enhanced models: 1 → 6 (+500%)
- Failure modes: 5 → 30 (+500%)
- Case studies: 9 → 40-60 (+344-567%)
- Automated detection: 0 → 1 system
- Test pass rate: 100% maintained
- Magnitude: 9/10 average

### Mental Models Applied to This Iteration

#### Leverage
- Each enhanced model multiplies value across all future analyses
- Automated detection scales failure mode utility

#### Compounding
- Enhanced models compound in value over time
- Each case study adds to collective wisdom

#### Pareto Principle
- 5 core Munger models deliver 80%+ of practical value
- Focus on depth creates more value than breadth

#### Opportunity Cost
- Not enhancing core models = leaving maximum value on table
- Automation now = 10x time savings later

#### First Principles
- What creates lasting value? Deep, actionable models
- What compounds? Wisdom + automation
- What scales? Automated detection

### Expected Iteration Magnitude: 9.2/10

**Why This Is High-Magnitude:**
1. **Depth Over Breadth**: 5 deeply enhanced models > 50 shallow models
2. **Automation**: Detection system multiplies value of all enhanced models
3. **Compounding**: Each enhancement increases value of entire system
4. **Munger-Aligned**: Focuses on his most important models
5. **Actionable**: Transforms philosophy into practical decision tools

### Quote for This Iteration
> "Take a simple idea and take it seriously." - Charlie Munger

This iteration takes the simple idea of "enhanced mental models with failure modes" and takes it seriously by:
- Expanding to Munger's 5 core models
- Adding comprehensive failure mode analysis
- Building automated detection
- Grounding in real-world case studies
