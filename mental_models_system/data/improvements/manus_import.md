## Improvement Suggestion: Enable effectiveness tracking

**Category:** system_optimization
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Impact:** 90%
**Estimated Effort:** medium

### Description
Model effectiveness tracking is not yet enabled. This prevents learning from decision outcomes.

### Rationale
Without effectiveness tracking, the system cannot learn which model combinations work best in different contexts.

### Evidence
- No effectiveness data found

### Implementation Steps
1. Integrate EffectivenessTracker into decision workflow
2. Record model combinations used for each decision
3. Track decision outcomes
4. Run periodic effectiveness analysis

### Related Models

## Improvement Suggestion: Add failure modes for Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency

**Category:** new_failure_mode
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Impact:** 70%
**Estimated Effort:** medium

### Description
The mental model 'Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency' has only 0 failure modes. Target is at least 5 failure modes per model for comprehensive coverage.

### Rationale
Insufficient failure mode coverage increases risk of misapplying the model. Each model should have documented failure modes with real-world cases.

### Evidence
- Current failure mode count: 0
- Target failure mode count: 5
- Gap: 5 failure modes needed

### Implementation Steps
1. Research common misapplications of Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency
2. Document real-world cases where the model was misapplied
3. Identify warning signs for each failure mode
4. Define safeguards to prevent each failure mode
5. Add to failure_modes JSON files

### Rationale
Insufficient failure mode coverage increases risk of misapplying the model. Each model should have documented failure modes with real-world cases.

### Evidence
- Current failure mode count: 0
- Target failure mode count: 5
- Gap: 5 failure modes needed

### Implementation Steps
1. Research common misapplications of Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
2. Document real-world cases where the model was misapplied
3. Identify warning signs for each failure mode
4. Define safeguards to prevent each failure mode
5. Add to failure_modes JSON files

Insufficient failure mode coverage increases risk of misapplying the model. Each model should have documented failure modes with real-world cases.

### Evidence
- Current failure mode count: 0
- Target failure mode count: 5
- Gap: 5 failure modes needed

### Implementation Steps
1. Research common misapplications of Breakpoints/Phase Transitions
2. Document real-world cases where the model was misapplied
3. Identify warning signs for each failure mode
4. Define safeguards to prevent each failure mode
5. Add to failure_modes JSON files
