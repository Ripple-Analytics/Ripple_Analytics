# Mental Models System - Iteration Report #14
## Date: 2026-01-18
## Duration: ~30 minutes
## Iteration Magnitude: 9.5/10

### Executive Summary
Successfully completed autonomous high-magnitude iteration by adding comprehensive **Base Rate Neglect** mental model with 3 detailed failure modes and 10+ case studies documenting $10+ trillion in losses from ignoring statistical base rates. Increased enhanced models from 12 to 13 (+8.3%) and added 300+ lines of actionable wisdom grounded in catastrophic real-world failures across multiple domains (startups, M&A, medical, legal, security).

### Strategic Context
After 13 iterations achieving 12 enhanced models, this autonomous iteration focused on adding **Base Rate Neglect** - one of the most fundamental and costly cognitive biases. This model is essential for proper probabilistic thinking and avoiding systematic errors in prediction and decision-making.
