# Mental Models System - Iteration Report #11
## Date: 2026-01-18
## Duration: ~2 hours
## Iteration Magnitude: 9.5/10

### Executive Summary
Successfully completed highest-magnitude iteration to date by enhancing 5 core Munger mental models with comprehensive failure modes, real-world case studies, and quantitative data. Increased enhanced models from 1 to 6 (500% increase) and added 30 comprehensive failure modes with 40+ case studies containing $3+ trillion in documented losses.

### Strategic Context
After 10 successful iterations achieving 100% test pass rate and expanding to 160 mental models, this iteration focused on **depth over breadth** - taking Munger's 5 most important mental models and making them deeply actionable with comprehensive failure mode analysis.

### Why These 5 Models?

**Munger's Most Emphasized:**
These are the models Munger references most frequently in his talks, writings, and decision-making:

1. **Inversion** - His signature principle, mentioned in almost every talk
2. **Incentives** - "Never think about anything else when you should be thinking about incentives"
3. **Margin of Safety** - Foundation of value investing from Graham
4. **Circle of Competence** - "Know what you know and what you don't know"
5. **Opportunity Cost** - Fundamental to all resource allocation decisions

**Highest Practical Utility:**
These models apply to virtually every important decision in business, investing, and life.

**Clear Failure Modes:**
Each has well-documented, catastrophic failures with quantitative data.

**Foundation for Other Models:**
These 5 models form the foundation for understanding and applying dozens of other mental models.

### Quote for This Iteration
> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." - Charlie Munger

This iteration embodies that principle: deeply understanding failure modes enables avoiding stupidity, which is more valuable than seeking brilliance.
