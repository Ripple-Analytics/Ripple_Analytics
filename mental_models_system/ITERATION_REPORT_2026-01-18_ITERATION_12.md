### Quote for This Iteration
> "I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person's brain because it understands the most fundamental models." - Charlie Munger

This iteration embodies that principle: deeply understanding fundamental models (systems thinking, first principles, asymmetric risk, reversible decisions, compounding) enables better decision-making.
