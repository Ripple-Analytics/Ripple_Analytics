## KEY QUOTES FROM MUNGER
"You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely--all of them, not just a few."
"To the man with a hammer, the world looks like a nail."
"If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form."
"These models supply the analytical structure that enables us to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals."
