# Charlie Munger Principles for Mental Models Desktop Development

## Source: Gmail and Google Drive Documents

### Core Development Philosophy (from Munger's Worldly Wisdom)

1. **Latticework of Mental Models**: You need models from multiple disciplines - psychology, economics, physics, engineering, biology. Facts must hang on a latticework of theory.

2. **Rule of 3 Models**: Never attack a problem with just one model. Use:
   - One psychological lens
   - One economic lens  
   - One mathematical/structural lens

3. **Two-Track Analysis**: Always apply both:
   - Track 1: Rational analysis (facts, incentives, numbers, base rates, expected value)
   - Track 2: Psychological analysis (biases, misjudgments, irrational behavior)

4. **Inversion**: Always ask "If everything goes wrong, why?" and "If success fails to appear, what prevented it?"

5. **Lollapalooza Effect**: Watch for when multiple models line up (bias + incentive + feedback loop + power law) - that's where outsized outcomes happen.

6. **80-90 Models Carry 90% of the Freight**: Focus on the most important models first.

7. **Psychology of Misjudgment**: The 25 tendencies are foundational - they explain most human error.

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Engineering Models are Most Reliable**: Quality control based on Fermat/Pascal mathematics
2. **Backup Systems**: Engineering idea of redundancy is critical
3. **Critical Mass**: The notion from physics - thresholds where dynamics change
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Elementary high school algebra applied to real problems
5. **Psychology is Foundational**: The 25 tendencies explain most human misjudgment
6. **Always Tell People Why**: The Five W's rule - who, what, where, when, WHY
7. **Incentives Drive Everything**: "Never think about something else when you should be thinking about incentives"

### Design Principles for the Desktop App

Based on Munger's philosophy:
1. **Information Density**: Like Value Line - pack maximum useful information
2. **Multiple Lenses**: Show each model from psychology, economics, and systems perspectives
3. **Failure Mode Detection**: Active safeguards against misapplication (Lollapalooza detector)
4. **Decision Tracking**: Learn from outcomes over time
5. **Bayesian Updating**: Update beliefs based on evidence
6. **Inversion Built-In**: Always show "what could go wrong"
7. **Checklist Approach**: Systematic application of models
